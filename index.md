# Hi! I'm Aaditya

I'm currently doing a PhD at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit in London, where I'm lucky to be co-supervised by [Andrew Saxe](https://www.saxelab.org/people/andrewsaxe/) and [Felix Hill](https://fh295.github.io/). I'm interested in building and better understanding safe AIs that can push the frontiers of human reasoning and help us do science as safe and helpful assistants. During my PhD, I've also had the pleasure of interning at Meta AI (with [Ari Morcos](http://www.arimorcos.com/) and then on the [LLaMa 3/3.1](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/) team) and [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).

Before my PhD, I did my undergrad and master's at MIT, where I double majored in Computer Science and Neuroscience, and was supervised by Boris Katz and Ila Fiete. I also did a smattering of internships in software engineering, quantitative research, and computer vision.
